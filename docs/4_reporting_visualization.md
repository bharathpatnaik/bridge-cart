## Overview: Reporting & Visualization

The final step is to expose these aggregated metrics and segment insights to stakeholders through dashboards and reports.

### Key Elements

1. **KPIs & Metrics**  
   - We highlight churn rates, average CLV, segment contributions to total sales, etc.
2. **Interactive Dashboards**  
   - Plots and charts allow quick analysis of changing trends, pipeline drift, and historical performance.
3. **Model Metrics**  
   - If we run advanced models, we can track their accuracy and performance over time.

### Example

- A marketing manager opens a web dashboard to see how Segment 3â€™s churn has changed in the past week.
- They notice an increase, drill down to see that more customers switched to a competing product, and decide to adjust promotions.

### Why It Matters

- **Actionable Insights**: A well-designed dashboard helps non-technical users understand and act on data quickly.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: We can identify issues (like pipeline delays) and quickly correct them.
